## Hello! 👋
I am a web developer, aspiring game developer and life-long learner. Currently refining my skills and trying to excel as a software developer.
Pursuing some new experiences like **making open-source contributions**, **deploying my own website**, **releasing a full game**.

## About me:

- 📫 How to reach me: seno.jeweljosef@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play League of Legends competitively in local tournaments and also dabbled in being a shoutcaster (with my forte being a color commentator). Fun times😛
